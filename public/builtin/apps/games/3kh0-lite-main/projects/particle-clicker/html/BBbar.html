Although suspected for a long time, this was first discovered in 1987 by the ARGUS collaboration at DESY in Germany.<p>With neutral B mesons, CP violation can now be studied very effectively. Important experiments making use of B oscillation have been the so-called B factories BaBar (in the US) and Belle (in Japan), as well as LHCb at CERN. These experiments have studied CP violation on a massive scale, looking at a large number of different decays of B mesons, as well as (more recently) Bs mesons and D mesons. So far, no deviation from the CKM mechanism by Kobayashi and Maskawa has been observed.<h5><b>Resources</b></h5><ul><li><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bâ€“Bbar_oscillation target=_blank>B-Bbar on Wikipedia</a></ul>
