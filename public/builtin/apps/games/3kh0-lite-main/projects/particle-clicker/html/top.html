<p class=lead>You discovered the top quark!<h5><b>The top quark</b></h5><img class=img-responsive src=assets/info/t.png alt="A proton and an antiproton annhilate to form a top-antitop pair" align=center><p>At 174.2 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, the top quark is the heaviest particle we know of. It belongs to the third generation of quarks and has a charge of &frac23; times the electron charge. As a result of its large mass, it decays (mostly into bottom quarks) almost instantly after it is produced. This behemoth does not form bound states with other quarks or antiquarks.<p>It was discovered by the DÃ˜ and CDF collaborations at Fermilab in the US. Nowadays, top quarks and their properties are studied intensively by ATLAS and CMS at CERN.<h5><b>Resources</b></h5><ul><li><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark target=_blank>The top quark on Wikipedia</a></ul>
