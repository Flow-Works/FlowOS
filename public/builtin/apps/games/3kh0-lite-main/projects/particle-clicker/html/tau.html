<p class=lead>You discovered the τ lepton!<section data-min-level=1><h4>The τ lepton</h4><img class=img-responsive src=assets/info/tau.png alt="A plot from the original publication" align=right><p>The τ (tau) is an elementary particle that can be thought of as a much heavier cousin of the electron, with a spin of &frac12;. It belongs to the family of leptons, along with the electron, the muon, and the three neutrinos. Despite the origin of the word lepton (meaning fine, small, thin) the τ is very massive at 1776.82 MeV/c<sup>2</sup>, which is nearly 3500 times the mass of the electron and around twice the mass of the proton.</section><section data-min-level=5><h5>The discovery of the τ</h5><p>The τ was detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl and his colleagues at the SLAC-LBL group. Their equipment consisted of SLAC’s then-new e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>&minus;</sup> colliding ring, called SPEAR, and the LBL magnetic detector. They could detect and distinguish between leptons, hadrons and photons.<p>Martin Perl shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics with Frederick Reines. The latter was awarded his share of the prize for experimental discovery of the neutrino.</section><hr><h5><b>Resources</b></h5><ul><li><a href=http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.1489 target=_blank>The original publication by M.
