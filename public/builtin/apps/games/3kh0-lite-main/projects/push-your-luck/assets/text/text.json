    "DIALOG_RULES_TAB0_CONTENT": "In Push Your Luck, players guess whether the next spin will be |c2HIGHER|~c or |c1LOWER|~c than the previous one. If you guess correctly, you stay in the round. If you guess wrong, you're out until the next round.\n\nWhen the wheel lands on a number, that number gets added to the |c0BANK|~c. After each spin, you can |c0BANK|~c instead of guessing. When you do that, the points in the |c0BANK|~c get added to your score, and you safely sit out until the next round.\n\nOnce per game you can use your |c3FREE SPIN|~c. This magic ticket lets you get points from the next spin, risk-free, without guessing |c2HIGHER|~c or |c1LOWER|~c. Use it wisely!\n\nOnce a player |c0BANKS|~c 100+ points, that triggers the final round. At the end of that round, the player with the most points wins the game.\n\nWhen the game ends, you gain or lose rating points based on your finish position. Gain points to climb all the way to Diamond! But the higher you go, the better you'll need to finish to keep improving your rating.",
    "DIALOG_RULES_TAB1_TITLE": "What is Probability?",
    "DIALOG_RULES_TAB1_CONTENT": "Probability is the likelihood that something will happen. It's usually measured as a fraction or a percentage. For example, when you flip a coin, HEADS will come up half the time, so the probability (or \"odds\") of HEADS is 1/2 or 50%.\n\nThis is a great way to think about your decisions in Push Your Luck. If the first spin is a 10, you can figure out the probability of whether the next spin will be |c2HIGHER|~c or |c1LOWER|~c. Look at the remaining numbers, and count how many are |c1LOWER|~c (1-9) and |c2HIGHER|~c (11, 12, and 13). Since there are 12 total numbers remaining, the odds of it coming up |c1LOWER|~c are 9/12 (75%) and the odds of |c2HIGHER|~c are 3/12 (25%). As you can see, |c1LOWER|~c is the higher probability choice.\n\nUnderstanding probability will give you an edge in Push Your Luck and help you understand many situations in daily life!",
    "DIALOG_RULES_TAB2_TITLE": "Tips & Tricks",
    "DIALOG_RULES_TAB2_CONTENT": "|bWhen to Bank:|~b\nDeciding when to |c0BANK|~c is one of the most important decisions in Push Your Luck. Of course, the higher the bank gets, the more you'll want to cash in the points. But it's also important to look at how risky it is to guess. For example, if there are the same amount of numbers for |c2HIGHER|~c or |c1LOWER|~c, then guessing gives you a 50% chance that you will bust. But if there's only 1 number higher and 9 numbers lower, guessing |c1LOWER|~c gives you only a 10% chance of busting.\n\nHowever, if other players are close to 100 points (and winning the game), and you're far from 100 points, it sometimes makes sense not to |c0BANK|~c, and continue to push your luck.\n\n|bGoing against the odds:|~b\nYour first instinct might be to always pick |c2HIGHER|~c or |c1LOWER|~c based on which of those is more likely to come up, but there are actually times you should consider going against the odds. If you're stuck in 7th or 8th place, and other players are close to 100 points, taking the long-shot guess might be your best chance -- because you can't gain ground by picking the same as the players ahead of you.\n\n|bPro Tip:|~b |c2HIGHER|~c numbers are worth more points, so sometimes it pays to guess |c2HIGHER|~c even when the odds are with |c1LOWER|~c.\n\n|bUsing Your Free Spin:|~b\nYou get only one |c3FREE SPIN|~c per game, so knowing when to use it is crucial. One trick is to look at which numbers are left on the wheel. If there are more high numbers left, then the |c3FREE SPIN|~c is likely to earn a lot of points. Don't wait too long to use it because you don't want to be stuck with it when the game ends.",
